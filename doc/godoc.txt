2. Commands                 |godoc-commands|

4. Project Settings         |godoc-project-settings|

=============================================================================
1. Introduction                                 *godoc-intro*

vim-godoc is a plugin that takes care of the management of godoc
documentation in Vim. It will (re)generate godoc documentation as you work
while staying completely out of your way.

In order to generate documentation, godoc will have to figure out what's in
your project. To do this, it will locate well-known project root markers like
SCM folders (.git, .hg, etc.), any custom markers you define (with
|godoc_project_root|).


=============================================================================
2. Commands                                     *godoc-commands*

                                                *godoc-project-commands*
The following commands are only available in buffers that have been found to
belong to a project that should be managed by godoc. See
|godoc_project_root| for how godoc figures out the project a file
belongs to. When no project is found (i.e. the file is not under any of the
known project markers), godoc is disabled for that buffer, and the
following commands and remarks don't apply.

If you want to force-disable godoc for a given project even though it does
match one of the items in |godoc_project_root|, create a file named
"`.nogodoc`" at the root of the project.

                                                *:godocRegen*
:GodocRegen
                        Manually (re)generate the godoc documentation.
                        This can be useful when |godoc_auto_regen| is set to
                        0.



Some debugging/troubleshooting commands are also available if the
|godoc_define_advanced_commands| global setting is set to 1.

:GodocOpen
                        Opens the documentation file on the browser. Both the
                        file and the browser can be customized with
                        |godoc_browser_file| and |godoc_browser_cmd|.




Some debugging/troubleshooting commands are also available if the
|godoc_define_advanced_commands| global setting is set to 1.


                                                *:godocToggleEnabled*
:GodocToggleEnabled
                        Disables and re-enables godoc.
                        When godoc is disabled, it won't (re)generate
                        godoc when you save a buffer. It will however still
                        look for project markers as you open new buffers so
                        that they can start working again when you re-enable
                        godoc.

                        {only available when
                        |godoc_define_advanced_commands| is set}

                                                *godocToggleTrace*
:GodocToggleTrace
                        If you want to keep an eye on what godoc is doing,
                        you can enable tracing. This will show messages every
                        time godoc does something. It can get annoying
                        quickly, since it will require you to press a key to
                        dismiss those messages, but it can be useful to
                        troubleshoot a problem.

                        {only available when
                        |godoc_define_advanced_commands| is set}


=============================================================================
3. Global Settings                              *godoc-settings*

The following settings can be defined in your |vimrc| to change the default
behaviour of godoc.

                                                *godoc_enabled*
g:godoc_enabled
                        Defines whether godoc should be enabled. When
                        disabled, godoc will still scan for project root
                        markers when opening buffers. This is so that when you
                        re-enable godoc, you won't have some buffers
                        mysteriously working while others (those open last)
                        don't.

                        Defaults to `1`.

                                                *godoc_trace*
g:godoc_trace
                        When true, godoc will spit out debugging
                        information as Vim messages (which you can later read
                        with |:messages|).

                        Defaults to `0`.

                                                *godoc_project_root*
g:godoc_project_root
                        When a buffer is loaded, godoc will figure out if
                        it's part of a project that should have godoc managed
                        automatically. To do this, it looks for "root markers"
                        in the current file's directory and its parent
                        directories. If it finds any of those markers,
                        godoc will be enabled for the project. This is
                        important because by default, this plugin will use the
                        project's root directory to run godoc.

                        The default markers are:
                        `['.git', '.hg', '.svn', '.bzr', '_darcs', '_darcs', '_FOSSIL_', '.fslckout']`

                                                *godoc_include_filetypes*
g:godoc_include_filetypes
                        A |List| of file types (see |'filetype'|) that godoc
                        should use. When a buffer is opened, if its
                        'filetype' is found in this list, godoc features
                        will be available for this buffer.

                        Defaults to godoc officially supported languages:
                        (`['typescript']`).



                                                *godoc_exclude_project_root*
g:godoc_exclude_project_root
                        A list of project roots to generally ignore. If a file
                        is opened inside one of those projects, godoc
                        won't be activated. This is similar to placing
                        a `.nogodoc` file in the root of those projects, but
                        can be useful when you don't want to, or can't, place
                        such a file there.
                        Defaults to `['/usr/local', '/opt/homebrew', '/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew']`,
                        which are the folders where Homebrew is known to
                        create a Git repository by default.

                                                *godoc_project_root_finder*
g:godoc_project_root_finder
                        When a buffer is loaded, godoc uses a default
                        (internal) implementation to find that file's
                        project's root directory, using settings like
                        |g:godoc_project_root|. When you specify
                        |g:godoc_project_root_finder|, you can tell
                        godoc to use a custom implementation, such as
                        `vim-projectroot`. The value of this setting must be
                        the name of a function that takes a single string
                        argument (the path to the current buffer's file) and
                        returns a string value (the project's root directory).
                        Defaults to `''`.
                        Note: when set, the called implementation will
                        possibly ignore |g:godoc_project_root|.
                        Note: an implementation can fallback to the default
                        behaviour by calling
                        `godoc#default_get_project_root`.

                                                *godoc_generate_on_new*
g:godoc_generate_on_new
                        If set to 1, godoc will start generating the docs
                        when a new project is open. A new project is
                        considered open when a buffer is created for a file
                        that has not been "seen" yet
                        in the current Vim session -- which pretty much means
                        when you open the first file in a given source control
                        repository.
                        When set to 0, godoc won't do anything special.

                        Defaults to 1.

                                                *godoc_generate_on_write*
g:godoc_generate_on_write
                        If set to 1, godoc will (re)generate godoc
                        documentation when a file inside that project is
                        saved. See |godoc_project_root| for how godoc
                        locates the project.
                        When set to 0, godoc won't do anything on save.
                        This means that the docs won't reflect
                        the latest changes, and you will have to run
                        |godocUpdate| manually.
                        Defaults to 1.

                                            *godoc_generate_on_empty_buffer*
g:godoc_generate_on_empty_buffer
                        If set to 1, godoc will start generating the godoc
                        documentation even if there's no buffer currently open,
                        as long as the current working directory (as returned by
                        |:cd|) is inside a known project.
                        This is useful if you want godoc to generate the
                        docs right after opening Vim.

                        Defaults to 0.

                                            *godoc_resolve_symlinks*
g:godoc_resolve_symlinks
                        When set to 1, godoc will resolve any symlinks in
                        the current buffer's path in order to find the project
                        it belongs to. This is what you want if you're editing
                        a symlink located outside of the project, and it
                        points to a file inside the project. However, this is
                        maybe not what you want if the symlink itself is
                        part of the project.
                        Defaults to 0.

                                            *godoc_init_user_func*
g:godoc_init_user_func
                        When set to a non-empty string, it is expected to be
                        the name of a function that will be called when a file
                        is opened in a project. The function gets passed the
                        path of the file and if it returns 0, godoc won't
                        be enabled for that file.

                        You can use this to manually set buffer-local
                        settings:

                        Defaults to "".

                                            *godoc_define_advanced_commands*
g:godoc_define_advanced_commands
                        Defines some advanced commands like
                        |godocToggleEnabled|.


                                            *godoc_auto_regen*
g:godoc_auto_regen
                        When setted to 1, godoc will automatically generate
                        the documentation for you.

                        If you prefer to generate the docs manually, you can
                        use the command |godocRegen|. In this case you might want
                        to set this this global to 0.

                        Defaults to 1.

                                            *godoc_cmd*
g:godoc_cmd
                        This is the command that godoc uses to generate the
                        project documentation.

                        Please, take the default value of this global as reference.

                        Defaults to "godoc".


                                            *godoc_browser_cmd*
g:godoc_browser_cmd
                        It is the program that will be used to open
                        |godoc_browser_file|.

                        This can be your internet browser, or anything else,
                        really.

                        Defaults to "xdg-open".

                                            *godoc_browser_file*
g:godoc_browser_file
                        The file that will be opened by the command
                        |godocOpen|.

                        Defaults to "./docs/index.html".

                                            *godoc_verbose_manual_regen*
g:godoc_verbose_manual_regen
                        Display a message on the status bar when godoc is
                        manually regenerated using the command :|godocRegen|.
                        Normally, used through a keybinding.

                        Defaults to "1".


                                            *godoc_verbose_open*
g:godoc_verbose_open
                        Display a message on the status bar when the godoc
                        documentation is opened on the browser using the
                        command :|godocOpen|. Normally, used
                        through a keybinding.

                        Defaults to "1".


=============================================================================
4. Project Settings                             *godoc-project-settings*

godoc can be customized to some extent on a per-project basis with the
following files present in the project root directory:

                                                *godoc-.nogodoc*
`.nogodoc`: if this file exists, godoc will be disabled completely for that
project.
